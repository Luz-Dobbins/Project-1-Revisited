# Project 1 Revisited

 
## Linear Regression

### The coefficients show that the sale of items is dependent on the store type with supermarkets having a higher coefficient and grocery store type having a negative effect on sales.


## Decision Tree

### The decision tree has a major importance of Item_MRP which after being informed of what it means, I do agree that individuals will look at a price and decide on purchasing or not.

### They are very much the same or close to the same. All the top important features are present in both bar plot.

### The most important features are Item_MRP, Item_Visibility, and Item_Weight. I see that there are other features that have smaller impacts to the sales of the stores. The newer stores are having a negative affect to sales and super markets type 3 are giving a negative impact all around.



## Lime

### Max Item_visibility

### Min Item_Visibility

### The Lime Explainer has the Item_MRP as the biggest impact of all the other features, with a .64% factor of impact on the sales of the stores. I think the company to look to out source more budget-friendly options. You can see with more visibility a product sells better with less visibility the item has more negatives going on in the Lime Explorer

### I used item_visibility for the force plots on both the decision tree regression and the linear regression to see the effects it presents for sales per store. I like the decision tree plot and think doing it on a random forest would give a better comparison for this part of the assignment.

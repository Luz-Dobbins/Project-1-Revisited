To me the plot shows how the type of store make a difference for sales. This is one of the reasons I go to walmart. You can get your cars oil changed and get your groceries.

The decision tree has a major importance of Item_MRP and that doesn't matter when selling a product. That information is for restock and the scanning of sold items. It does have the store type as a significant factor too.

In my opinion running a few more models will help narrow down the true factor for sales.
